Welcome to the Game of Life!

This is a take on the Conway's Game Of Life that is designed to simulate the life and death of multiple generations of cells that are in one of two states:
Alive (represted by a 1) or Dead (represented by a 0). Whether a cell lives or dies in a generation is goverend by the following rules:

1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Instructions

1) From the Main Menu, type in '2' and hit enter
2) Enter the dimensions for the game board you want to simulate
3) Enter the number of genreations that you want to simulate
4) The board with you given dimensions will be generated and randomly seeded with live and dead cells.
5) Follow the on screen instructions and see the results of the little universe you just genreated!
