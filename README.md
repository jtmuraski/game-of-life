# Conway's Game Of Life

### Introduction
This application is my personal take on the Conway Game Of Life challenge. For those who do not know this problem, or need a refresher on it, please follow this link to learn more about it:

I worked on this project in order to practice algorithms and working with data structures, and quite simply because I have never heard of this until a couple of days ago and wanted to try solving it. This application is writtern purely as a C# console app.
